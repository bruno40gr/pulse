# Table toolbars

- Leads and Contacts instantiate `components/ui/RichDataTable.tsx`. It owns the toolbar layout, metadata-column picker, density, visible-column sizing and detail-cell projection. Domain adapters supply rows, columns, toolbar actions and a stable preference schema; do not clone the table or its controls per page.
- Use `TablePersonName` for parent/detail table names. Details retain normal weight even when a domain supplies a profile-opening action; Leads details can remain display-only. All name actions use the shared name control. No family chevrons, detail checkboxes or “Via” labels.
- `TableDisplayControls` is the shared picker (also used in the design-system showcase), not a Leads-specific control. Storage is tenant/membership/table scoped; Leads keeps its released storage key.

- Use shared `Button variant="secondary" size="toolbar"` for peer toolbar actions, including column-picker triggers. Do not hand-style a native summary to resemble a button.
- Use shared `Select controlSize="toolbar"` for compact toolbar filters. This uses the same sizing, border, typography and radius as toolbar buttons. Do not override it with legacy input styles.
- Align controls centrally with `spacing.sm` gaps and allow wrapping on narrow screens. Keep the display-options trigger at the right edge.
- Toggle state uses `aria-pressed` and a check indicator; disclosure state uses `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls`. Escape closes the picker and restores trigger focus; outside clicks and tabbing out dismiss it.
- The columns picker contains only the column choices and row-spacing control. Do not add saved-preference helper copy or a reset action.
- Preferences remain browser-local and membership-scoped. Toolbar interactions must not add polling or per-column requests.
- The live component example is the **Table toolbar** section in `/dashboard/design`.
